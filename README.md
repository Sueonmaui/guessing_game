# guessing_game
Monday May 5 assignment
An exercise on prompts in Javascript, simple for some but my first attempt for me.
It works like this: Answer the questions posed. That's it!

Elliot and I made the game better by changing the original "yes" or "no" answer to three choices. The variable used for the user's response was removed and replaced with text strings for matching within three sets of If-Else statements.
